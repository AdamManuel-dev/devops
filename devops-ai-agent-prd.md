# Product Requirements Document: AI DevOps Monitoring Agent

**Version:** 1.0.0  
**Date:** January 2025  
**Product Name:** IntelliOps AI Agent  
**Document Status:** Draft

## 1. Executive Summary

IntelliOps AI Agent is an autonomous cloud-deployed monitoring system that continuously analyzes logs, metrics, and alerts from DevOps infrastructure. The agent uses AI to categorize issues, provide intelligent solutions, analyze root causes, and manage alert routing based on severity and working hours. By leveraging vector embeddings and pattern recognition, it learns from historical issues to provide increasingly accurate diagnoses and solutions over time.

The system integrates with GitHub to analyze source code related to errors, performs complexity and quality analysis, and provides natural language querying capabilities for real-time system health insights.

## 2. Problem Statement

### Current Challenges
- **Alert Fatigue**: DevOps teams receive hundreds of alerts daily without proper prioritization or context
- **Manual Triage**: Engineers spend 40-60% of their time manually categorizing and investigating issues
- **Knowledge Loss**: Solutions to recurring problems aren't systematically captured or reused
- **After-Hours Burden**: Critical issues often require immediate attention regardless of time, leading to burnout
- **Root Cause Opacity**: Determining why issues occur requires manual log correlation and code analysis
- **Slow Response Time**: Average time to resolution increases due to lack of automated analysis

### Impact
- Increased operational costs due to manual intervention
- Delayed issue resolution affecting SLAs
- Engineer burnout from constant on-call responsibilities
